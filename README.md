# Diary of Knowledge
Some days ago I was studing and learning about Web Development but I'm not was noting what I was learning. I decided to create a diary to know what I'm learning and remember when I forget something.

I'm using the [`Habitica`](https://habitica.com/) to manage my tasks during the day and the week.

The days ago I don't remember either write down the courses I did and what I learned.

### What I learned:

#### HTML5 and CSS
  - **class="nameClass01 nameClass02 ... nameClassN"** | that is, how we can to separate nameClasses in the same class
  - **!important** | to give priority to some class or id, in other words, it override whatever parameter passed to another class or id
  
#### Bootstrap
  - **col-xs-4** | col = column, xs = extra small, 4 = number of parts that you want to catch. There are 12 parts of column in Bootstrap, I caught 4 parts
  - **col-md-*** | md = medium, * = all. Catchs all parts of columns, that is, 12 parts
  - **class="img-responsive"** | class of Bootstrap. Turns your image in a responsive image
  - **```<i class="fa fa=into-up"></i>```** | Like icon
  - **```<i class="fa fa-into-trash"></i>```** | Trash icon
  - **```<i class="fa fa-into-circle"></i>```** | Information icon
  - **```<i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i>```** | Paper's plane icon
  - **form-control** | used for submit button
